CoffeeMaker Assignment
=================================

My task is to create a file, `CoffeeMakerTest.java`, which properly tests the `CoffeeMaker` class to ensure it is working properly. 

This exercise focuses entirely on testing.  You are NOT to fix the coffee maker.  You are only to develop tests to exercise the functionality as described in the requirements.

## Assignment Report
* [Test Cases Listing](../../wiki/Test%20Case%20)
* [Requirement Traceability Matrix](../../wiki/Requirement%20Traceability%20Matrix)
* [Bug Report](../../wiki/Bug%20Report)
* [Instruction how to run unit test](../../wiki/Instruction%20how%20to%20run%20tests)


## Directory Structure
 * `build.gradle` -- the build file that will help you build the SUT and tests as well as execute the tests and measure coverage
 * `gradlew` -- script to run gradle from a *NIX system
 * `gradlew.bat` -- script to run gradle from Windows
 * `src/main/java` -- contains the system under test (SUT; in this case, the coffee maker code) and all of its dependencies.  Do not modify any of this code.
   - `edu.ncsu.csc326.coffeemaker.*` -- the code for the system under test (the coffee maker)
 * `src/test/java` -- the test code
   - `edu.ncsu.csc326.coffeemaker.CoffeeMakerTest` -- the JUnit tests for the `CoffeeMaker` class.  You will need to update this file.
 * `build/reports` -- contains the different reports generated by the build.  NOTE: This directory will only exist once a gradle build has been run!
   - `tests/test/index.html` -- the JUnit test report (describing which tests passed and which failed); this file is only created if the unit tests are executed.
